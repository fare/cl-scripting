cl-scripting, utilities for scripting in Common Lisp
====================================================

cl-scripting is a collection of utilities for scripting in Common Lisp.

For examples on how I use them, see [fare-scripts](http://github.com/fare/fare-scripts).

Contents:

* [cl-scripting.asd](cl-scripting.asd): the .asd file,
  which trivially uses package-inferred-system.

* [failure.lisp](failure.lisp): recording failure of subtasks,
  so you can report in the end which things went wrong in a script.
